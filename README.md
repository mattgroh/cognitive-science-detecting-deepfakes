# Code and Data for Replication "Deepfake Detection by Crowds, Machines, and Machine-Informed Crowds"

You can replicate the results from the paper with the `replication-notebook-deepfake-detection-crowds-machines.ipynb` jupyter notebook.

You can download the stimuli from the Deepfake Detection Challenge Dataset from the [official website](dfdc.ai), and you can find the additional stimuli from the `videos` folder, which are based on the following 4 Youtube videos: [Putin Fake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbFHhpYU15w), [Putin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CnyqLogH0Y), [Jung-un Fake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERQlaJ_czHU), [Jung-un](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exI0FEubxO0)
